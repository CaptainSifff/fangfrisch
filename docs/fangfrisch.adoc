Fangfrisch (German for "freshly caught") is a sibling to the https://www.clamav.net[Clam Anti-Virus]
freshclam utility.
It allows downloading virus definition files that are not official ClamAV canon, e.g. from https://sanesecurity.com[Sanesecurity].

== Update strategy

Fangfrisch is expected to run periodically, e.g. using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron[cron].
Download attempts are recorded in a database and new attempts are only made after the defined age threshold is reached.
Fangfrisch will attempt to download digests first (if available upstream), and only retrieve corresponding virus definition files when their recorded digest changes, minimising transfer volumes.

== Installation

Fangfrisch requires Python 3.7 or newer.
The recommended installation method is using the https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/[pip command] in a virtual Python environment.
Here is an example listing of commands for BASH:

----
include::install.txt[]
----

== Configuration

A configuration file is mandatory and uses an INI File structure.
It must contain at least a default section with the options shown below.
The suggested path is `/etc/fangfrisch.conf` but the file can be stored elsewhere if you prefer.
A description of SQLAlchemy's DB URL syntax is available https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html#supported-databases[here].
Typically, a local https://www.sqlite.org[SQLite] database will suffice.
Internal default values for Sanesecurity can be used by enabling an optional section as shown below.

----
include::sample.conf[]
----

Points of note:

* Section names are case-sensitive.
* Max age is specified in minutes.
* Integrity checks can be turned off by using the value `disabled`.

You can also add your own sections for additional virus definition providers.
See https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/configparser.html[here] for a detailed description of the configuration file parser.
The parser uses extended interpolation, i.e. `${section:option}` style references to options defined elsewhere in the file.

----
include::user.conf[]
----

Fangfrisch will scan enabled sections for lines prefixed with `url_` to determine download sources for virus definition files.
The value of `integrity_check` determines both the expected filename suffix for digests and the hashing mechanism used for verification.

== Prepare the database

After completing the configuration, make sure to create the database structure by running the `initdb` command.

----
python -m fangfrisch --conf /etc/fangfrisch.conf initdb
----

WARNING: Fangfrisch should never be run as `root`, but as an unprivileged user like `clamav`.

== Usage

You can display command line arguments as follows:

----
$ python -m fangfrisch --help

include::usage.txt[]
----

You can choose among following actions:

* *dumpconf*: Dump the effective configuration to stdout, combining both internal defaults and your own settings.
The effective configuration for the example shown in <<Configuration>> is available in <<sampleeff>>.

* *initdb*: Create the database structure.
This needs to be run only once, before the first refresh.

* *refresh*: Refresh the configured URLs.
The `force` switch can be set to force downloads regardless of local file age.

As stated before, Fanfrisch is typically run using cron.
An example crontab looks like this:

----
# minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week user command
*/30 * * * * clamav python -m fangfrisch --conf /etc/fangfrisch.conf refresh
----
